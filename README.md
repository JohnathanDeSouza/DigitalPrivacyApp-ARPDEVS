## üõ† Tech Stack
This project is a full-stack application built with the MERN stack principles, using Node.js and Express for the backend and React for the frontend.

Frontend
React: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces with a component-based architecture.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for all styling to create a modern and responsive design.
Heroicons: A high-quality library of SVG icons used throughout the application for a polished user experience.
JavaScript (ES6+): The core programming language for the frontend logic and interactivity.

Backend
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows for running JavaScript on the server.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build the REST API.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for creating secure access tokens to handle user authentication and session management.
bcrypt: A library for hashing user passwords to ensure they are stored securely.
Swagger: Used for generating interactive API documentation, making the backend endpoints easy to understand and test.

Testing
Jest: A delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity, used for running unit and integration tests.
Supertest: A library for testing Node.js HTTP servers, used to make requests to the API endpoints and assert their responses.
